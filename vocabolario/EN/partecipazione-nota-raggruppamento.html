If the participation in the tender is by a business grouping, the obligation of transmitting
the tender documentation to the Platform is borne solely by the lead group representative, which,
before sending the tender documentation, will have to include the companies making up the group within the system.
Registration to the portal is mandatory for the lead group representative, while it is not mandatory
for the other companies represented.
